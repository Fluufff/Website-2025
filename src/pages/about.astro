  <Content headline="What is Flüüfff?" bg="secondary">
    <p>Flüüfff 2026 is the 8th edition of the Flüüfff convention.</p>

    <p>
      It is an annual nonprofit gathering of furries from across Belgium (and far beyond!) — for fun, for creativity,
      for self-expression, and for joy. From late-night dances to cozy panels, from chaotic karaoke to quiet corners,
      Flüüfff is what you make of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a project hosted and run by volunteers through a nonprofit organization (ASBL/VZW), we depend on the amazing
      people who give their time, energy and heart to make this event happen.
    </p>

  <Content headline="Our mission" sideImage={missionImage} right id="mission">
    <p>
      Flüüfff is Belgium’s premier furry convention—a vibrant, five-day celebration of anthropomorphic creativity,
      community, and joy. Held annually in Belgium, Flüüfff brings together furries and friends from across Europe and
      beyond to share in a spirit of inclusivity, imagination, and fun.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are more than just a convention; we are a gathering of kindred spirits who value friendship, self-expression,
      and the boundless possibilities of the furry fandom. Whether you're dancing like a party animal, lounging with new
      friends, showcasing your fursuit, or participating in panels and games, Flüüfff is your space to be your authentic
      self.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each edition of Flüüfff is themed—from seaside holidays and abbey adventures to tropical islands and grand
      casinos—offering fresh experiences and memories year after year. Our commitment to creativity, respect, and
      community ensures that everyone feels welcome, whether you're a seasoned furry or a curious newcomer.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a registered non-profit organisation (ASBL/VZW), we reinvest all proceeds into enhancing future events or
      supporting charitable causes, reflecting our dedication to giving back to the community that makes Flüüfff
      possible.
    </p>

    <p>Come as you are, leave as part of the Flüüfff family.</p>

  <Content headline="What is the furry fandom?" sideImage={fandomImage}>
    <p>
      The furry fandom is a community inspired by anthropomorphic animals (animals with human traits).<br />
      People who are part of the fandom are called furries.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can compare it to other fan communities like Star Wars, anime, or fantasy fairs.<br />
      The furry fandom is mainly about creativity and is also known as a very social community. Most furries create their
      own character (also called a fursona), based on a certain animal, real or otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are regular animals, hybrids, mythical creatures, and some even invent their own species. If there’s a
      meetup or convention, you’ll likely find people wearing fursuits — costumes based on their fursona.
    </p>
    <p>
      At conventions and within the community, it’s all about creating art, writing stories, roleplaying, socialising,
      and making and wearing fursuits.
    </p>
    <p>Most furry conventions and several furry groups also raise funds and organize panels for various charities.</p>
