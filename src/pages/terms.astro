    <h2>4. Code of Conduct</h2>
    <p>Flüüfff is committed to creating a safe, respectful, and welcoming environment for everyone. By attending the convention, you agree to follow the rules below. These are here to ensure all attendees — whether it’s your first con or your fiftieth — can enjoy the experience fully and comfortably.</p>

    <h3>4.1 Respect and Inclusion</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Harassment, discrimination, or inappropriate behavior of any kind will not be tolerated.</li>
      <li>Always ask for consent — whether it’s for a photo, a hug, or a conversation.</li>
      <li>If you experience or witness something that makes you uncomfortable, please report it to a staff member. We’re here to help.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.2 Badges and Identification</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Convention badges must be worn visibly at all times within convention areas.</li>
      <li>Badges are personal and non-transferable. Sharing, duplicating, or altering badges is strictly prohibited.</li>
      <li>Attendees must be at least 18 years old and may be asked to show ID at check-in or during the event.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.3 Attire, Clothing, and Fursuiting</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>All clothing must be decent and appropriate for a public, mixed-audience environment. Excessively revealing, fetish-related, or offensive clothing or accessories are not allowed.</li>
      <li>Nudity or clothing simulating nudity is not permitted.</li>
      <li>Fursuits and partial suits are welcome but must allow for safe movement and proper visibility.</li>
      <li>Fursuiters must ensure their costume is safe to wear in public spaces, does not pose hazards to themselves or others, and can be removed quickly in case of emergency.</li>
      <li>Wearing fursuit parts (tails, ears, paws, etc.) is allowed, but they must not be used inappropriately or disruptively.</li>
      <li>Props or costume parts resembling weapons must be clearly non-functional and may be subject to staff inspection.</li>

      <li>Do not pull on tails, ears, or other costume parts, even in jest. These actions can damage costumes and may be considered harassment.</li>
      <li>Be mindful of the reduced vision and hearing that fursuiters may experience, and take extra care when approaching or speaking to them.</li>
      <li>Be aware that some items of clothing, apparel, or similar items might bring the convention and/or fandom into disrepute and should not be worn in public. If you have to ask or think twice about doing something in public, it is a good indication that you should take it to your room.</li>
      <li>Convention staff reserves the right to determine whether any clothing and/or accessories contravene the following rules. Questions regarding rules for clothing and outfits should be directed to the department head of Stewards & Safety, who can be contacted at conops[at]fluufff.org.</li>

      <li>Personal photography is welcome, but always ask permission before photographing other attendees, especially those in fursuit.</li>
      <li>Photography is not allowed in designated private areas such as the Dealer’s Den.</li>
    </ul>
