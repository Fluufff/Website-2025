      ready, gear up for a colourful adventure where every level is both familiar and fresh. Flüüfff 2026 launches into
      its next edition; this time, in full retro-arcade style.

    <p>
      Flüüfff is one of the oldest furry conventions in Belgium, small enough to be cozy and big enough to be fun. It’s
      a place where you can express yourself freely, meet kindred spirits, and celebrate what makes you come alive,
      whether that’s in fur, feathers, or something all your own. No suit required. No experience needed. Just curiosity
      and an open mind.
