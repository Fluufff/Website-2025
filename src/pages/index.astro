      This year, when the veil between worlds grows thin, a hidden forest stirs.
      Creatures of every shape and stripe gather under lush, green branches.
      Flüüfff returns for its 7th edition—this time, as a Forest Fantasy nestled
      in the heart of Brussels.

      Flüüfff is a Belgian furry convention right in the heart of Brussels!<br
      />
      It’s a 5-day celebration of everything furry — a place where fans of anthropomorphic
      characters, their friends, and curious visitors come together to connect, celebrate,
      and have fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      This year, Flüüfff takes place from <strong
        >November 5th to 9th, 2025</strong
      >, at the <strong>Bedford Hotel & Congress Center</strong>.

    <p>
      Flüüfff is one of the oldest furry conventions in Belgium, small enough to
      be cozy and big enough to be fun. It’s a place where you can express
      yourself freely, meet kindred spirits, and celebrate what makes you come
      alive — whether that’s in fur, feathers, or something all your own. No
      suit required. No experience needed. Just curiosity and an open mind.
