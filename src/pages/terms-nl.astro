      <p>
        All vendors, artists, and exhibitors are fully responsible for the content and legality of the items and
        services they offer during Flüüfff.
      </p>
      <p>By participating as a seller (in the Dealer’s Den, Artist Alley, or elsewhere), you confirm that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You own the rights to all materials you display or sell, <strong>or</strong></li>
        <li>You have obtained clear permission or licensing to use them.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The sale of plagiarised, copied, AI-generated, or otherwise infringing works (including unlicensed fan art that
        violates known IP rights) is not permitted.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the Flüüfff team receives a credible complaint or identifies a potential infringement, we reserve the right
        to:
      </p>
      <ul>

        However, we will always act in good faith to maintain a respectful, legal, and community-focused environment.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Code of Conduct</h2>
      <p>
        Flüüfff is committed to creating a safe, respectful, and welcoming environment for everyone. By attending the
        convention, you agree to follow the rules below. These are here to ensure all attendees — whether it’s your
        first con or your fiftieth — can enjoy the experience fully and comfortably.
      </p>

      <h3>4.1 Respect and Inclusion</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Harassment, discrimination, or inappropriate behavior of any kind will not be tolerated.</li>
        <li>Always ask for consent — whether it’s for a photo, a hug, or a conversation.</li>
        <li>
          If you experience or witness something that makes you uncomfortable, please report it to a staff member. We’re
          here to help.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.2 Badges and Identification</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Convention badges must be worn visibly at all times within convention areas.</li>
        <li>
          Badges are personal and non-transferable. Sharing, duplicating, or altering badges is strictly prohibited.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may not impersonate official convention roles, e.g., by intentionally wearing a misleading lanyard or badge.
        </li>
        <li>
          Changing or covering up any information on your badge (e.g., by using stickers or drawings) is strictly forbidden.
        </li>
        <li>Attendees must be at least 18 years old and may be asked to show ID at check-in or during the event.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.3 Attire, Clothing, and Fursuiting</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All clothing must be decent and appropriate for a public, mixed-audience environment. Excessively revealing,
          fetish-related, or offensive clothing or accessories are not allowed. This includes pup hoods, harnesses, and
          bondage gear.
        </li>
        <li>
          We make an exception to the above point and explicitly allow some specific accessories. Out of fursuit: collars,
          unbound wrist cuffs. In fursuit: harnesses, collars, muzzles, leash, unbound wrist cuffs.
        </li>
        <li>Nudity or clothing simulating nudity is not permitted.</li>
        <li>Wearing costumes, accessories, or displaying items made out of real fur is prohibited.</li>
        <li>Fursuits and partial suits are welcome but must allow for safe movement and proper visibility.</li>
        <li>
          Fursuiters must ensure their costume is safe to wear in public spaces, does not pose hazards to themselves or
          others, and can be removed quickly in case of emergency.
        </li>
        <li>
          Wearing fursuit parts (tails, ears, paws, etc.) is allowed, but they must not be used inappropriately or
          disruptively.
        </li>
        <li>
          Props or costume parts resembling weapons must be clearly non-functional and may be subject to staff
          inspection.
        </li>
        <li>
          Always treat fursuiters and those wearing costume parts with respect. Do not touch, hug, or interact
          physically with a fursuiter without clear and explicit consent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not pull on tails, ears, or other costume parts, even in jest. These actions can damage costumes and may be
          considered harassment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be mindful of the reduced vision and hearing that fursuiters may experience, and take extra care when
          approaching or speaking to them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be aware that some items of clothing, apparel, or similar items might bring the convention and/or fandom into
          disrepute and should not be worn in public. If you have to ask or think twice about doing something in public,
          it is a good indication that you should take it to your room.
        </li>
        <li>
          Convention staff reserves the right to determine whether any clothing and/or accessories contravene the
          following rules. Questions regarding rules for clothing and outfits should be directed to the department head
          of Stewards & Safety, who can be contacted at conops[at]fluufff.org.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.4 Photography and Media</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Flüüfff may be documented by our official media team. By attending, you give us permission to use photographs

          please notify staff.
        </li>
